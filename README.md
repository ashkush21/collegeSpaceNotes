# collegeSpaceNotes
notes page for collegespace
### key features (optimisations)
all the icons are in base64 form, that's code so would be fastest to load when compared to importing from a server
only resources to be imported are the json files for the links and the collegeSpace logo
#### Not a single Library has been used, keepin it LITE. xD

## The project is in prototype(version 1) stage,
### with basic skeleton and skin, the muscles(links swapping and adding to the semester bars) left to be added!

## Icons' svg codes from [Code Charm's Font-Awesome-SVG-PNG repo](https://github.com/encharm/Font-Awesome-SVG-PNG)
